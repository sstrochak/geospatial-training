# Mapping and Geospatial analysis in R

## Introduction

Geospatial analysis is one of the fastest growing areas of R. In particular, the `sf` package provides a tidy and intuitive way to analyze and visualize spatial data.

### Why map in R?

1)  *Reproducibility*: Creating maps with R code means that other collaborators can easily check and replicate your work.
2)  *Iteration*: With point and click software like ArcGIS, making 50 maps would be 50 times the work/time. But mapping in R, allows you to easily make many iterations of the same map with a few alterations.
3)  *Easy Updates/Changes*: Writing code provides a roadmap for others (and future you!) to update the map as needed.
4)  *Expansive package ecosystem*: There are several R packages that make it very convenient to get spatial data, create static and interactive maps, and perform spatial analyses. Some of these packages include:

-   `sf`: For managing and analyzing spatial dataframes
-   `tigris`: For downloading in Census geographies
-   `ggplot2`: For making publication ready static maps
-   `urbnmapr`: For automatically adding Urban styling to static maps
-   `mapview`: For making exploratory interactive maps


## Reading in spatial data

```{r libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(urbnthemes)
library(urbnmapr)
library(tigris)
library(mapview)

```

### Reading in shapefiles/geojsons

The `st_read()` function allows you to read in any spatial file format, such as shapefiles (`.shp`) or GeoJSONs (`.geojson`), as an `sf` dataframe. Once read in, you can reproject the coordinate reference system for your data. When mapping and performing geospatial operations, it is important that all data are in the same projection.

```{r read-sf}

list.files("shapefiles")

msa_boundary <- st_read(dsn = "shapefiles",
                        layer = "2015 MSA Boundary")

msa_boundary <- st_transform(msa_boundary, crs = 4326)


st_geometry(msa_boundary)

```

### Reading in CSV's

If you have a CSV or other dataset that contains latitudes and longitudes, you can easily convert your data to a `sf` point dataframe. It is important to know what coordinate reference system the coordinates are based on, so you can properly assign the CRS or projection. Note that `st_set_crs` is used to assign a projection; `st_transform` is used to alter a projection that already exists.

```{r read-csv, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

banks <- read_csv("data/fdic-sod-dc_2017.csv")

banks_sf <- banks %>% 
  # Filter out 2 rows without lat or lons
  filter(!is.na(sims_longitude) | !is.na(sims_latitude)) %>% 
  # Convert regular dataframe to an sf dataframe. Need to specify lon, lat (in that order!)
  st_as_sf(coords = c("sims_longitude", "sims_latitude")) %>% 
  st_set_crs(4326)

```

### Reading in Census boundaries

There are many packages that make it easy to read in Census boundaries. The `tigris` package for example allows you to pull states, tracts, CBSAs, and even roads and military bases. For a full list of supported Census geographies see [here](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris).

```{r tigris, results='hide'}

options(tigris_class = "sf")

dc_tracts <- tracts(state = "DC",
                    cb = TRUE,
                    year = 2010) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

```

The `urbnmapr` package contains geographic data that can be used to easily make state and county level maps, with AL and HI displayed as insets. This packages also supports US territories.

```{r urbnmapr}

dc <- get_urbn_map(map = "states", sf = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(state_fips == "11") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

```

## Static Mapping

`geom_sf` from `ggplot2` allows you to map point, line, polygon, and multipolygon `sf` dataframes. The syntax follows that of other `geom_*` functions- provide a data set and a set of aesthetics. If you are using an `sf` dataframe (which contains the coordinates saved in a column called `geometry`), then you are not required to provide any aesthetics. But you can if you say want to color in states by a particular variable.

You can also layer geoms on top of each other; they will appear from bottom to top.

```{r ggplot}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = msa_boundary, 
          mapping = aes()) +
  geom_sf(data = banks_sf,
          mapping = aes(), 
          alpha = .2, 
          color = palette_urbn_cyan[5],
          stroke = FALSE) +
  theme_urbn_map() +
  labs(title = "FDIC Insured Bank Branches in the Washington DC MSA")

```

For examples of choropleth maps, see the [`urbnmapr` vignette.](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr). For examples of other types of maps, see the Urban Institute [mapping guide](https://ui-research.github.io/r-at-urban/mapping.html).

## Clipping

`st_crop` will crop your data to the bounding box of another spatial data set.

```{r crop, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

banks_crop <- st_crop(banks_sf, dc)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dc, 
          mapping = aes(), 
          fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = banks_crop, 
          mapping = aes(),
          color = palette_urbn_cyan[5]) +
  theme_urbn_map() 


```

`st_intersection` will provide an exact clip.

```{r intersection, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

banks_int <- st_intersection(banks_sf, dc)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dc,
          mapping = aes(), 
          fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = banks_int, 
          mapping = aes(),
          color = palette_urbn_cyan[5]) +
  theme_urbn_map()


```

## Spatial joins

Say, for instance, you want to map out census tracts in DC, colored by the number of FDIC-insured bank branches they have. Doing this would involve:

1)  Performing a point to polygon spatial join to figure out the Census tract that each bank falls into
2)  Counting the number of banks by Census tracts
3)  Making a map

The function `st_join` has many different options to spatially join geometries. The [`sf` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/sf.pdf) is a great resource for remembering and determining which function to use. When using `st_join`, the the geometry of the first object is retained, and the geometry of the second object is lost.

```{r spatial-join, message=FALSE}

# Perform spatial join between banks (point) and tracts (polygons)
banks_with_tract_appended <- st_join(banks_int, dc_tracts, join = st_intersects)

# Count number of banks by tract
bank_count_by_tract = banks_with_tract_appended %>% 
  # GEO_ID = unique id for a tract
  count(GEO_ID, 
        name = "num_banks") %>% 
  st_drop_geometry()

# Append count of number of banks to dc_tracts dataframe
dc_tracts = dc_tracts %>% 
  left_join(bank_count_by_tract, 
            by = "GEO_ID") %>% 
  mutate(num_banks = ifelse(is.na(num_banks), 0, num_banks))

# Create map of banks by Census tract
 dc_tracts %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = num_banks)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn() +
  theme_urbn_map() +
  labs(fill = "Number of banks per census tract")


```

## Buffers

The function `st_buffer` can be used to create buffers around geometries. It is important to reproject your data out of long/lat based projectsion to calculate accurate buffers.

Here, I project the bank coordinates into Marlyand State plane in feet in order to calculate a half mile buffer. `library(units)` is helpful for setting and converting between units.

```{r buffer, message=FALSE}

banks_proj <- banks_int %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 2248)

banks_buffer <- banks_proj %>% 
  st_buffer(units::set_units(.5, mi) %>% units::set_units(ft)) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(dc, mapping = aes(), 
          fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(banks_buffer, mapping = aes(),
          fill = "#1696d2", alpha = .3, color = NA) +
  theme_urbn_map() 
  

```


## Interactive Mapping

The `mapview` package makes it very easy to create interactive maps with `sf` dataframes. All you have to do is run `mapview(your_sf_object)`. You can layer multiple `sf` dataframes on top of each other with `mapview(sf1) + mapview(sf2)`

```{r mapview, message = FALSE}

mapview(dc_tracts)

mapview(dc_tracts) + mapview(banks_int, col.regions = palette_urbn_green[6])

```

For more information on the options available on the `mapview` libary, see Day 4 of our [Mapping 101 training](https://ui-research.github.io/urbn101-mapping/).
